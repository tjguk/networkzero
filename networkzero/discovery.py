"""Advertise and collect advertisements of network services

The discovery module offers:

* A UDP broadcast socket which:
  - Listens for and keeps track of service adverts from this and other 
    machines & processes
  - Broadcasts services advertised by this process

* A ZeroMQ socket which allow any process on this machine to 
  communicate with its broadcast socket

In other words, we have a beacon which listens to instructions
from processes on this machine while sending out and listening 
to adverts broadcast to/from all machines on the network.

The beacon is started automatically in a daemon thread when the first 
attempt is made to advertise or discover. If another process already 
has a beacon running (ie if this beacon can't bind to its port) this 
beacon thread will shut down with no further action.

The module-level functions to advertise and discover will open a connection
to a ZeroMQ socket on this machine (which might be hosted by this or by another
process) and will use this socket to send commands to the beacon thread which
will update or return its internal list of advertised services.

As an additional convenience, the :func:`advertise` function will, if given no
specific address, generate a suitable ip:port pair by interrogating the system.
This functionality is actually in :func:`core.address` (qv).
